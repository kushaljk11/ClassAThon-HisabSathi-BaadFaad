# BaadFaad Business Model

This document explains BaadFaad’s business strategy in simple terms: what problem we solve, how we are different, how we can earn, and how we scale.

## 1) Problem We Solve

People splitting bills (especially students and young professionals) face three common issues:

- manual math errors,
- delayed repayments,
- social awkwardness when reminding friends.

BaadFaad solves this by combining instant split calculation, local payment support, and polite reminders.

## 2) Value Proposition (Why BaadFaad)

BaadFaad is built for Nepal-first usage, unlike global tools such as Splitwise/Tricount.

### Core Differentiators

- **Local-first product**: NPR support and local wallet/payment integration (eSewa, Khalti).
- **Fast and lightweight**: Progressive Web App (PWA), no mandatory app download.
- **Low-friction usage**: users can split and settle quickly, even with minimal onboarding.
- **Social comfort layer**: anonymous/soft reminder flow reduces debt-related awkwardness.

## 3) Revenue Model

BaadFaad uses a multi-stream model so growth and sustainability can happen together.

### A) Freemium SaaS

- Free core experience for mass adoption.
- Premium tier: **NPR 199/month** for advanced features (recurring groups, richer history/analytics).

### B) Transactional Fees

- Platform convenience fee on settlements via integrated rails.
- Fee range: **0.5% to 1%** per transaction.

### C) B2B Promotional Partnerships

- Restaurants/cafes can buy visibility inside the platform (sponsored menu placement, shoutouts).
- Campaign pricing range: **NPR 20,000 to NPR 200,000** based on exposure.

## 4) Go-to-Market Roadmap

### Phase I: Regional Focus (0–6 months)

- Focus cities: **Itahari + Dharan**.
- Partner with top **50 student-favored restaurants/cafes**.
- Place QR-led entry points at tables.
- Target: **1,000 active users** and ~**10% premium conversion**.

### Phase II: National Scale (6–12 months)

- Expand to broader Nepal market.
- Integrate with POS systems for direct bill-to-app flow.
- Target: **5,000 users** and around **NPR 200,000 monthly revenue**.

### Audience Strategy

- Primary segment: **18–30 years** (students + young professionals).
- Channels: Meta ads, campus activations, community events.

## 5) Market Opportunity

- Estimated reachable base: **6k+ active smartphone users**.
- Digital wallet ecosystem: **NPR 100k+ monthly transaction volume**.
- Opportunity: become the “social settlement layer” on top of existing payment rails.

## 6) Risk & Backup Plan

### Main Risk

- Consumer growth may be slower than expected in early stages.

### Mitigation / Pivot

- “Zero Customer” B2B pivot: offer BaadFaad as an internal **Fast Checkout Tool** for restaurants.
- Value for merchants: faster table turnover, smoother staff workflow, lower billing friction.
