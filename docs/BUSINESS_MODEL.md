*Business Strategy and Model*
This document outlines the strategic business framework for BaadFaad, detailng how we solve a critical market friction in Nepal through a sustainable, scalable, and profit-driven model.


*Value Proposition & Competitive Moat*
BaadFaad differentiates itself from global alternatives like Splitwise and Tricount by solving hyper-local challenges specific to the Nepalese Gen-Z demographic.

Unlike international platforms, BaadFaad focuses on providing local support such as currency in NPR and integration of local payment APIs like eSewa and Khalti.
Utilizing a Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture, which enables users to calculate and complete bill splits and also make payments within seconds without the need of mandatory registration or downloading the application.

By automating anonymous payment reminders through WhatsApp, the system helps prevent social awkwardness related to debt, paying bills on time into frictionless social interaction.


*Diversified Revenue Streams*
Our financial sustainability is built on a multi-layered monetization strategy that balances user growth with profitability.

Freemium SaaS Model: The core utility remains free for casual users to drive mass adoption, while a Premium Tier (NPR 199/month) provides advanced features such as recurring group profiles and comprehensive spending history.

Transactional Commissions: We capture a convenience fee of 0.5% to 1% on every settlement processed through our integrated payment rails, directly monetizing the transaction volume.

B2B Promotional Partnerships: The platform serves as a marketing channel for restaurants and cafes, offering sponsored food menu placements and shoutouts ranging from NPR 20,000 to NPR 200,000 based on the exposure plan.


*Strategic Execution Roadmap*
Our tactical approach focuses on building regional density before scaling to a national fintech ecosystem.

Phase I: Regional Dominance (0–6 Months): We aim to capture the Itahari and Dharan dining circuits by partnering with the top 50 student-favored establishments to place QR codes directly on dining tables. This phase targets a base of 1,000 active users with an estimated 10% premium conversion rate.

Phase II: National Expansion (6–12 Months): Our objective is to scale to 5,000 users and NPR 200,000 in monthly revenue by integrating with national Point of Sale (POS) systems, allowing bill data to flow into the app automatically via API.

Targeted Outreach: We focus specifically on the 18–30 age demographic (students and young professionals) through high-intent channels including Meta advertisement campaigns and on-campus seminars.


4. Market Reality & Risk Mitigation
BaadFaad is positioned within a rapidly growing digital landscape with a built-in contingency for market fluctuations.

Market Scale (TAM): We are operating in a market with over 4 million active smartphone users and a digital wallet transaction volume exceeding NPR 40 Billion monthly, representing a massive opportunity for a specialized logic layer.

Contingency Strategy: If organic consumer adoption stalls, our "Zero Customer" pivot involves transitioning into a B2B Service Provider. In this model, we offer BaadFaad to restaurant owners as an internal "Fast-Checkout" tool to enhance staff efficiency and streamline customer turnover.
